# Quickstart
 The name's self-explainatory; a quickstart app. Windows-only, as of now.
# Running
 - Download and unpack the code into a folder wherever you want
 - Find the said folder in the command prompt
 - Run "pip install -r requirements.txt" and wait for all the stuff to install
 - Open main.py in a text editor and edit lines 89 and 90 with your town and country. Otherwise, the app won't work.
 - Run "python3 main.py" to run the app
 - If you want to use plugins, close the app and go into your user directory. You should find a folder called "quickstart" there, and a "plugins" folder inside. Drop your plugins, or the example ones, into the folder and run the app again.
# To-do
 - Add actual functionalities
 - Woulda be nice to make an interface for choosing the weather locaion
 - do stuff
